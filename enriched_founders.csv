This superionic transition in Li3YCl6 is triggered by the collective motion of anions, as evidenced by synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering characterizations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Based on this finding, we used a rational design strategy to lower the transition temperature and thus improve the room-temperature ionic conductivity of this family of compounds. We accordingly synthesized Li3YClxBr6−x and Li3GdCl3Br3 and achieved very high room-temperature conductivities of 6.1 and 11\u2009mS\u2009cm−1 for Li3YCl4.5Br1.5 and Li3GdCl3Br3, respectively.\nA huge thank you to all the co-authors and collaborators who contributed to this exciting work!\n,,,, Mu Lu, Shuo Chen,, Jue Liu,,\nCheck out the full article here:', 'date': '', 'reactions': '0', 'is_repost': False, 'original_author': None, 'repost_comment': None}, {'text': 'We are thrilled to announce the official publication of our research article ""low-cost iron trichloride cathode for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries"" in Nature Sustainability! \nThis study is an ""accidental"" outcome of our halide electrolyte Li3YCl3Br3 project. In 2021, we planned to use Li3YCl3Br3 electrolyte to assemble high-performance solid-state cells. Nonetheless, due to the oxidation stability issue of Br-, lithium transition metal oxide cathodes like LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and NMC are not suitable candidates as cathode materials to pair with Li3YCl3Br3 electrolyte. Considering the good compatibility between Li2S and sulfide electrolytes in solid-state cells, halide electrolytes are probably fine with metal chloride cathodes. Fortunately, we had a bottle of FeCl3 in our lab. In solid-state cells, FeCl3 showed surprisingly high operating voltages around 3.65 V vs. Li+/Li and quite stable cycling performance. Our results demonstrate that FeCl3 could deliver similar energy density as LiFePO4, but it only costs ~2% of LiFePO4. Such a reduction in cathode costs makes it possible to realize cheaper solid-state Li-ion batteries than Li-ion batteries using liquid electrolytes. We think it is a very promising cathode material and look forward to its commercialization.\nI\'d like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who supported us on this project.\nJue Liu,,,, Shuo Chen,, Ting Zhu and\n\n\nYou can read our paper here:', 'date': '', 'reactions': '0', 'is_repost': False, 'original_author': None, 'repost_comment': None}]"
